# CSCI-4220U
Computer Visions


### Course Description
This course introduces students to computer vision – the science and technology to make computers “see.” The goal of computer vision is to develop computational machinery to extract useful information from images and videos. The course will study various steps of the overall image analysis pipeline. Topics covered will include: image formation, image representation, segmentation, feature extraction, motion analysis, object detection, camera calibration, and
3D visual reconstruction. A secondary focus of this course will be applications computer vision, including mobile vision, which rely heavily upon the fundamental theory and techniques covered in this course.
